handycrop
=========
This Yii 1.1 widget will allow you to implement upload image with crop and save to database.
The aim is that with minimal effort you may get image upload + crop functionality.

It depends on certain other libraries and Yii Widgets:

Demo link coming shortly:____

Widget -
1. Yii EAjaxUpload
Libraries -
2. jcrop
3. WideImage - for watermark & resize

The extension HandyCrop has to be downloaded and put into your extension folder.
An example on how to use it is explained in readme.php which is within the extension folder.

Any issues can be dropped at invent@handysolver.com
